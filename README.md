🚦 Bangalore Traffic Analysis Project

Bangalore's rapid urban growth and increasing population have significantly impacted its traffic management system. This project analyzes and interprets traffic patterns using data science techniques. It focuses on how various factors such as time of day, weather conditions, roadwork, and public transport usage contribute to traffic congestion. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights to help in planning efficient traffic flow systems and promoting sustainable urban mobility.

This project leverages advanced data manipulation tools to extract meaningful patterns from raw traffic data, providing an in-depth understanding of how the city’s traffic behaves under various circumstances.

🎯 Key Objectives

📊 Analyze and Visualize Traffic Patterns

Collect traffic data from various sources, including traffic cameras, sensors, and government APIs.

Use visualization tools to understand traffic flow across different city areas and analyze traffic volume changes throughout the day.

Identify peak traffic hours and the most congested routes by plotting traffic patterns over time.

📍 Identify Congestion Hotspots and Contributing Factors

Map traffic volume using geospatial data to pinpoint congestion hotspots.

Analyze external factors like weather, public transport availability, and road repairs affecting congestion.

Prioritize locations requiring immediate attention for decongestion strategies.

🌧️ Evaluate the Impact of Weather, Roadwork, and Public Transport

Compare traffic volumes during various weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy) to assess their effects.

Study roadwork zones and their impact on traffic by correlating construction activity with slowdowns.

Analyze metro and bus usage to determine their role in reducing traffic density.

💡 Provide Data-Driven Insights for Better Traffic Planning

Implement dynamic traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic flow.

Suggest improvements in public transport services by identifying high-demand areas.

Recommend alternate routes to reduce congestion on heavily used roads.

Propose long-term infrastructure upgrades like flyovers and dedicated bus corridors.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

To ensure accurate analysis, the following data preprocessing steps are performed:

🗑️ Removing missing values and duplicate records for consistency.

🕒 Converting DateTime columns into appropriate formats for time-based analysis.

🔠 Encoding categorical variables (e.g., weather conditions) for better model performance.

⚠️ Filtering out outliers to prevent inaccurate insights.

Merging data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive dataset.

📈 Visualization Techniques

Data visualization helps uncover meaningful patterns. We employ the following techniques:

📉 Line Graphs: To display traffic volume changes over time (hourly, daily, weekly trends).

🔥 Heatmaps: To identify congestion hotspots and assist authorities in prioritizing areas for intervention.

📊 Bar Graphs: To compare traffic across different days of the week.

🥧 Pie Charts: To represent the impact of weather conditions on traffic.

📊 Interactive Dashboards: To dynamically explore traffic data using filters and time selectors.

🚥 Traffic Impact Analysis

🌧️ Weather Impact
