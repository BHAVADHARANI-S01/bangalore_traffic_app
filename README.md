📈 Unraveling Bengaluru's Traffic Dynamics

🌆 Introduction

Bangalore, famously known as India's Silicon Valley, faces an ongoing challenge: traffic congestion. With rapid urbanization and a growing tech industry, understanding traffic patterns is vital to enhance city infrastructure, reduce congestion, and improve public transport.

This project provides in-depth insights into key traffic metrics by analyzing:

Traffic volume

Congestion levels

Environmental impact

Incident patterns

🔍 Insights for Better Traffic Management

The analysis aims to:

Identify high-congestion zones and peak traffic times.

Understand the effect of weather and construction on traffic.

Evaluate public transport's role in reducing congestion.

These insights will assist city planners, policymakers, and commuters in developing efficient traffic strategies and promoting sustainable mobility solutions.

📚 Key Learnings

Data Availability Shapes Analysis:

Due to missing time data, we couldn't analyze peak traffic hours.

Early assessment of data quality is crucial to shape analysis objectives.

Data Challenges Assumptions:

Initial assumptions about construction being a major cause of traffic were disproven by the data.

Data visualization revealed more nuanced causes behind congestion.

Iterative Process of Data Insights:

Letting the data guide the narrative allowed for unexpected insights.

We learned to refine our hypotheses and methodologies as new patterns emerged.

📊 Conclusion

Our comprehensive analysis reveals:

Congestion Trends: Identified major bottlenecks and high-traffic days.

Impact of External Factors: Weather and festivals significantly affect traffic flow.

Public Transport Usage: Increasing reliance on public transit suggests room for future expansion.

These findings provide a data-driven foundation for improving road infrastructure, optimizing public transport, and fostering sustainable urban mobility in Bangalore.
